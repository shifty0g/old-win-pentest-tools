# Old Windows Pentest Tools 

This repo is for hosting those useful and hard to get oldskool windows tools that are useful for pentesting

Some were lost on the intenernet and a pain in the ass to track down so dont want to loose them and storing them here for us all to enjoy :) 

Its a bit of a mess at the moment but when i can be bothered I will sort it and add more 


Some worth while mentions in this repo

SL.exe
SNScan
SMBcrack2
Enum - useful for RID Cycling 
WinScanX - Again good for RID Cycling & SMB stuff
