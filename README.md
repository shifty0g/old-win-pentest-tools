# Old Windows Pentest Tools 

This repo is for hosting those useful and hard to get oldskool windows tools that are useful for pentesting

Some were lost on the intenernet and a pain in the ass to track down so dont want to loose them and storing them here for us all to enjoy :) 

Its a bit of a mess at the moment but when i can be bothered I will sort it and add more. 

If you have any gems please share. Fork, Clone, do whatever. Spread the love!

Some worth while mentions in this repo

* SL.exe - CLI port scanner (check out NimScan) 
* SNScan - Scanner + SNMP community string
* SMBcrack2 - crack SMB
* Enum - useful for RID Cycling 
* WinScanX - Again good for RID Cycling & SMB stuff
