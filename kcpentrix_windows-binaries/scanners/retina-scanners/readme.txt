NetSchedScan v1.00 

Remote Task Scheduler scanner
Copyright 2004 (c) by Foundstone, Inc.
http://www.foundstone.com

A Windows network admin utility for remotely detecting the Task Scheduler
vulnerability on Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems.
NetSchedScan allows you to scan multiple IP ranges for the Task Scheduler
buffer overrun.

Note: This tool does not require any authentication credentials.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows task scheduler is vulnerable to a remotely exploitable
buffer overrun when parsing specially crafted .job files.

The Microsoft Windows task scheduler allows local and remote users to
schedule jobs for future execution.

The task scheduler utilizes .job files to store data about jobs to be
executed. The .job files are stores in the %SystemRoot%\Tasks folder
and polled by the task scheduler. A buffer overrun exists in the
parsing of .job files and could be exploited through a malformed .job file
on a malicious web site or email.

Affected applications:

Internet Explorer 6 on Windows NT 4.0 SP6a

Affected operating systems:

Microsoft Windows 2000
Microsoft Windows XP
