This file gives a brief overview of the major changes between each ike-scan
release.  For more details please read the ChangeLog file.

ike-scan v1.8:

* Added many new vendor ID and UDP backoff patterns.  There are now a total
  of 29 backoff patterns, and 135 vendor ID patterns.

* Several bugs fixed in both psk-crack and ike-scan.  Notable fixes include:

  o Numeric arguments are now checked for validity
  o Perform 64-bit time calculations correctly
  o Correct psk-crack handling of multiple PSK records
  o Fixed bug which caused hostnames containing hyphens to fail with an error.
  o Name lookup errors are now non-fatal.

* Added support for more flexible transform specification, which allows
  an arbitary number of transform attributes to be specified in any order.

  This new method is specified by using an alternative syntax for the --trans
  option: --trans=(attr=value, ...).  The old syntax of --trans=(a,b,c,d) is
  still available.  Note that the brackets are special to some shells, and
  may need to be quoted.

* Made the specification of the lifetime and lifesize transform attributes
  with the --lifetime and --lifesize options more flexible.  Now, the argument
  to these options can take three different forms:

  o The string "none" - Do not add any lifetime or lifesize attribute.
  o A decimal integer, e.g. 86400 - Add a 4-byte value.
  o A hex number, e.g. 0xff - Add a variable length value.

  This allows arbitary length lifetime and lifesize attributes to be added
  using the hex notation.

* Changed default packet-rate calculation from interval to bandwidth.  The
  default outgoing bandwidth is 56000 bits per second, and can be changed with
  the --bandwidth option.  It is still possible to specify an inter-packet
  interval instead with the --interval option.

* Display the version, flags and msgid from the ISAKMP header if they don't
  contain the expected value.

* Decode and display CERTIFICATE, DELETE and NOTIFICATION payloads if they
  are received.

* Display the responder cookie from the ISAKMP header unless quiet is in effect.

* Display the SPI if its size is non-zero.  Normally, the SPI size is zero
  during Phase-1, but I've observed some implementations to use a non-zero
  length, which is permitted by RFC 2408.

* Added new options to allow more control of the outgoing packet.  Note that
  some of these options can make the outgoing packet non RFC compliant:

  o --spisize Adds a random SPI of the specified length to the proposal payload
  o --cookie Sets the initiatior cookie to the specified static value
  o --hdrflags Sets the flags field in the ISAKMP header
  o --hdrmsgid Sets the MsgID field in the ISAKMP header
  o --exchange sets the exchange field in the ISAKMP header to the specified value
  o --noncelen (-c) allows the length of the nonce data to be specified
  o --bandwidth (-B) specify desired outgoing bandwidth usage
  o --certreq (-C) Adds a CertificateRequest payload to the outgoing packet
  o --headerlen (-L) allows the ISAKMP header length to be manually specified
  o --mbz (-Z) allows the value for the reserved fields that "must be zero" to be sent to a specified non-zero value
  o --headerver (-E) allows the header version in the ISAKMP header to be changed from the default of 0x10 (v1.0)
  o --protocol (-j) allows the proposal protocol to be changed from the default
  o --transid (-k) allows the transform id to be changed from the default
  o --doi (-D) allows the DOI in the SA to be changed from the default
  o --situation (-S) allows the Situation in the SA to be changed from the default

* The full help output is now only displayed if it is specifically requested
  by running ike-scan with the --help (-h) option.  Usage errors now result in
  a smaller help output.  This avoids outputting a multi-screen usage message
  just because of a typo on the command line.

* drop root privilege after binding the local port if we are running SUID.
  This improves security somewhat.

* Make POSIX regular expression support mandatory.  Previously, it was
  optional, but I'm not aware of any supported systems that lack it, and we
  are using it in more and more places.

* Improved mapping of ID numbers to names in decode.  This allows sparse IDs
  ranges (e.g. 1,2,3,65000) to be supported, which means that we can now decode
  XAUTH authentication method amongst other things.

* Added SO_BROADCAST option to UDP socket to allow sending to broadcast
  addresses.  Previously this gave a permission denied error, even for root.

* Added OpenSSL exception to the copyright notice, which permits linking of the
  program against OpenSSL.  This is to allow the use of OpenSSL in this GPL v2
  licensed program.

ike-scan v1.7:

* Improved "make check" tests, so they now check more areas including Pre-
  Shared Key cracking, HMAC and Hash speeds, and HMAC and Hash test vectors.

* Added --nodns (-N) option to prevent DNS lookups.  With this option,
  target hosts are not processed with gethostbyname(), which can avoid
  delays when the system running ike-scan does not have functioning DNS.

* Added additional authentication methods and hash algorithms to the output
  decoding functions in isakmp.c

* Added new psk-crack program to perform offline aggressive mode pre-shared
  key cracking using the output from ike-scan with the --pskcrack option.
  This psk-crack program supports both dictionary and brute-force cracking
  modes against MD5 and SHA1-based HMAC hashes.

* Added ability to output aggressive mode pre-shared key (PSK) parameters
  for later offline cracking with the --pskcrack (-P) option.  This option
  outputs the pre-shared key parameters as colon-separated hex-encoded values
  in the following format:

  g_xr:g_xi:cky_r:cky_i:sai_b:idir_b:ni_b:nr_b:hash_r

  These parameter details can be used by the psk-crack program (which is
  supplied as part of the ike-scan package) to attempt to crack the pre-
  shared key.

* Added support for IKE over TCP with the --tcp (-T) option.  Two TCP
  variants are supported:

  --tcp=1 (-T1) specifies raw IKE over TCP as used by Checkpoint; and
  --tcp=2 (-T2) specifies encapsulated IKE over TCP as used by Cisco.

  Note that you can only scan one host at a time when using IKE over TCP.

  When using TCP, you can modify the connect() timeout with the
  --tcptimeout (-O) option.  Default timeout is 10 seconds.

* Added experimental timing error smoothing code, which is based on the TCP RTT
  smoothing algorithm in RFC 793.  This is disabled by default; to enable it,
  #define ALPHA in ike-scan.h

* Allow the ID (Identity) payload that is specified with the --id option to
  be specified as either a string e.g. --id=test or a hex value with a leading
  0x e.g. --id=0xdeadbeef.  Note that you will probably need to change previous
  ID payload strings because of this change, as previously they were always
  interpreted as hex.

* Added support for OpenSSL MD5 and SHA1 hash functions.  These are generally
  faster than the hash functions supplied with ike-scan, which is of benefit
  when performing pre-shared key cracking.

  To compile with OpenSSL, use the --with-openssl option to configure.  With
  this option, configure will search for the OpenSSL libraries in several
  standard locations.

* Added --random (-R) option to randomise the host list before scanning.
  This causes the hosts to be scanned in a random order, which may be less
  obvious than the default sequential scanning.  The Knuth shuffle algorithm
  is used to randomise the list.

* Changed host entry from a linked-list to a dynamic array which decreases the
  memory required from 56 bytes per target host to 45 bytes.

* Added several new Vendor ID patterns.

* Added several new UDP backoff patterns.

ike-scan v1.6:

* ike-scan will now display multiple Vendor ID payloads if the server sends
  more than one.  Previously, it would only display the first Vendor ID and
  ignore the others.

* Added support for ISAKMP lifetime size transform attribute with the
  --lifesize (-z) option.  This is specified as kilobytes.  The default is
  0 which means don't include the lifetime size attribute.

* Added support for GSS IDs with --gssid (-G) option.  GSS IDs are described in
  draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-gss-auth-07.txt.  This is used by Windows-2000
  IPsec for Kerberos authentication.

* Allow target hosts to be specified as IPnet/bits to include all hosts in
  the given network, or IPstart-IPend to include all hosts in the inclusive
  range as well as single hostnames or IP addresses.

* Added support for Vendor ID fingerprinting.  The file "ike-vendor-ids"
  contains a list of known Vendor ID patterns, specified as Posix extended
  regular expressions.  These are used to match against the ascii hex
  representation of any returned Vendor IDs, and the name of the entry is
  displayed if a match is found.

* SA transform attributes and ID payloads are now decoded, and basic details
  (name and size) are displayed for payload types that we don't decode yet.
  Added --quiet option to prevent this decoding if it's not required.
  Added --multiline option to split the decode over multiple lines - one line
  per payload.  With --multiline, each payload decode line starts with a TAB.

ike-scan v1.5.1:

* Fixed a bug which could cause a negative value to be passed to select()
  when collecting backoff fingerprints.  This would result in select()
  returning EINVAL.

ike-scan v1.5:

* Aggressive mode is now supported.  The --aggressive (-A) option specifies
  aggressive mode.

* The --trans option can be specified multiple times to generate an arbitrary
  number of custom transforms in the ISAKMP SA Proposal.

* The --vendor option can be specified multiple times to generate an arbitrary
  number of Vendor ID payloads.

* UDP engine improvements: Dynamically adjust select() timeout, removing the
  need for a --selectwait argument; keep track of cumulative timing error, and
  use this to adjust the timing to compensate; calculate timings in
  microseconds rather than milliseconds to improve accuracy; and some minor
  tuning.

ike-scan v1.4:

* Two additions to permit Vendor ID fingerprinting.
  1. Allow the specification of an arbitrary Vendor ID payload using the
     --vendor option.
  2. Display any Vendor ID payload returned by the target host.

ike-scan v1.3:	(Unofficial release)

* Added support for per-pattern-entry fuzz values in the backoff patterns
  file which allows more complex backoff patterns to be matched.
* Added new backoff patterns for "watchguard-soho" and "sonicwall-pro".

ike-scan v1.2:

* Fixed format string vulnerability in syslog() call.
* ike-scan now builds and runs on HP Tru64 Unix.

ike-scan v1.1:

* Added new backoff patterns for Cisco Concentrator and isakmpd.
* ike-scan now builds and runs on Windows/Cygwin, old libc5 Linux systems, and
  Solaris 2.8 / SPARC.
* Windows command-line binary released.

ike-scan v1.0: (Initial release)

* Compiles and runs on Debian Linux 2.2 "potato" and 3.0 "woody", FreeBSD 4.3,
  and OpenBSD 3.1.
