 		     Absinthe - Automated SQL Injection
	
 		     	  by nummish <nummish AT 0x90.org>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
=========================================================================

Absinthe 1.4.1 (Two trick pony...)

This is the biggest release of Absinthe since I GPL'd the code.
Absinthe is no longer just a Blind injection tool, this release has 
the basics of MS SQL Server error based injection. This runs a *LOT* 
faster than the blind stuff, so if it's an option, use it. Otherwise, 
the Blind for Oracle, SQL Server and PostGres are still there. They
will update the progress earlier, so use of the tool will be less painful.

If you have any questions or comments on the tool, please do not hesitate
to visit http://www.0x90.org/releases/absinthe or email us at: 
absinthe@0x90.org

An HTML user guide is available at:
http://www.0x90.org/releases/absinthe/docs

I've included a compiled version for straight install which includes
the current wx.NET DLLs required for Absinthe. 

With version 1.4, I've switched to using nant (nant.sf.net) as the build
tool. You will need to install this to build the binaries.
 
From this point, you can just run the install script as normal. 

Hopefully you find this useful.
